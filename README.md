**Problem statement:** 
AI-Powered Food Quality Detection and Grading – ACFP01

**Descriptions:**
Our project is an AI-powered solution that uses image processing and machine learning to classify food quality and ensure safety. It detects contaminants, predicts spoilage, monitors storage conditions, and identifies allergens to prevent food poisoning. By providing real-time alerts and actionable insights, it empowers consumers, retailers, and farmers to make informed decisions. The system also integrates traceability and hygiene monitoring to enhance food safety across the supply chain. Ultimately, it aims to reduce food waste, improve public health, and ensure access to safe, high-quality food for everyone.

**Tech Stack:**
Python: The core programming language for implementing the AI system. Python is widely used in AI and image processing tasks due to its simplicity and availability of libraries.

OpenCV: A powerful image processing library used for image manipulation, enhancement, feature extraction, and pre-processing. OpenCV will handle tasks such as resizing images, converting color spaces, and filtering noise.

CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks): Deep learning models specifically designed for image processing tasks. CNNs will be used to extract hierarchical features from images, such as edges, textures, and complex patterns in the food images.

TensorFlow/PyTorch: Popular machine learning frameworks used for training and deploying deep learning models. TensorFlow and PyTorch will enable you to train custom models for food quality classification, utilizing the power of GPUs to process large datasets.

Generative AI: generative AI to analyze food images and sensory data, identifying defects and grading products based on set standards. It ensures consistent quality control, reduces waste, and streamlines processes across the food industry.
